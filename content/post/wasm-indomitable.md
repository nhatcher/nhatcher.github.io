This is a _learning_ and a _teaching_ opportunity.

In this blog we will see how to create complex algorithms in C to calculate inverses and determinants of matrices
[LU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)

We will do the algorithms in C, we will use the latest version of clang to compile them directly to WebAssembly without using the standard C library.
For that purpose we will have to learn how to allocate and deallocate memory.

We will learn:

* Algorithms in Linear Algebra
* C without libc!
* Memory management: implementing `malloc` and `free`
* WebAssembly
* GitHub Actions
